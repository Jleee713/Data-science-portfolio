# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains the files for the Portfolio task for COMP2200/6200 in S2 2021. 

This repository consists of 3 files; 

* Portfolio 1
* Portfolio 2
* Portfolio 3

Combination of all 3 represent a great exmaple of data science with logical, thorough and appropriate analysis using many different techniques that are used in the modern data science workforce.

## Portfolio 1
#### Analysis of Cycling data.
This porfolio is provided with four files containing recordings of cycling activities that include GPS location data as well as some measurements related to cycling performace like heart rate and power. The goal is to perform some exploration and analysis of this data. It covers the basics of data science in which it demonstrates exploration of data, fundamentals of using and manipulating different data, and creating detailed analysis to such real world problems. It covers the basic visual representation factor of data science, which is crucial in delivering data and analysis in a variety of different ways. It involves playing around with the dataset, which demonstrates a good understanding of the data and the appropriate approach in solving real world data analysis problems.

## Portfolio 2
#### Sport Vouchers Program Analysis
The goal of this Portfolio task is to explore data from the Federal Government Sport Vouchers program - this is a program that provides up to two $100 vouchers for kids to participate in organised sport. Here's the [NSW Active Kids page](https://www.service.nsw.gov.au/transaction/apply-active-kids-voucher), there are similar schemes in other states - this data is from South Australia. It covers how to use multiple datasets and combine them for comparable analysis to a certain real world problem. One of the most important factors for a Data Analyst is to understand the data comprehensively so that analysis stage will be much more efficient and flexible. It involves extensive problem solving, creative thinking, calculations and presentation of results in a readable format for average non-data-analyst users. Also demonstrates, visual presentation of results in effective graphs such as pairplot and scatterplot, which are chosen for its suitability for the problem.

## Portfolio 3
#### Mobile Customer Churn

This portfolio uses data on Mobile Customer Churn. Churn is where a customer leaves the mobile provider. The goal is to build a simple predictive model to predict churn from available features. It covers data exploration and using machine learning techniques to make analysis and predictions based on the current dataset. Along with data exploration, the use of visual presentation to emphasize the results in a more readable way. It involves machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, training modelsa and Feature Selection (Recursive Feature Elimination).
